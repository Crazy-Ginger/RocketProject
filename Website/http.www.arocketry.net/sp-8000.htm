 <strong>Abstract:</strong> Criteria are presented for the
prediction of panel flutter, determination of its occurrence,
design for its prevention, and evaluation of its severity.
Theoretical analyses recommended for the prediction of flutter
stability boundaries, vibration amplitudes, and frequencies for
several types of panels are described. Vibration tests and wind
tunnel tests are recommended for certain panels and environmental
flow conditions to provide information for design of verification
analysis. Appropriate design margins on flutter stability
boundaries are given and general criteria are presented for
evaluating the severity of possible short-duration,
limited-amplitude panel flutter on nonreusable vehicles.</p>

<strong>Keywords:</strong> lunar and planetarty exploration,
atmospheric models, environment simulation, mars atmosphere,
design analysis, mission planning, spacecraft design<br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong>: Atmospheric models for support of design and mission
planning of space vehicles that are to orbit the planet Mars,
enter its atmosphere, or land on the surface are presented.
Quantitative data for the Martian atmosphere were obtained from
Earth-base observations and from spacecraft that have orbited
Mars or passed within several planetary radii. These data were
used in conjunction with existing theories of planetary
atmospheres to predict other characteristics of the Martian
atmosphere. Earth-based observations provided information on the
composition, temperature, and optical properties of Mars with
rather coarse spatial resolution, whereas spacecraft measurements
yielded data on composition, temperature, pressure, density, and
atmospheric structure with moderately good spatial resolution.
The models provide the temperature, pressure, and density
profiles required to perform basic aerodynamic analyses. The
profiles are supplemented by computed values of viscosity,
specific heat, and speed of sound.</p>

<strong>Abstract:</strong>: Criteria and recommended practices for the design of
the spaceborne elements of electronic imaging systems are
presented. A spaceborne electronic imaging system is defined as a
device that collects energy in some portion of the
electromagnetic spectrum with detector(s) whose direct output is
an electrical signal that can be processed (using direct
transmission or delayed transmission after recording) to form a
pictorial image. This definition encompasses both image tube
systems and scanning point-detector systems. The intent was to
collect the design experience and recommended practice of the
several systems possessing the common denominator of acquiring
images from space electronically and to maintain the system
viewpoint rather than pursuing specialization in devices. The
devices may be markedly different physically, but each was
designed to provide a particular type of image within particular
limitations. Performance parameters which determine the type of
system selected for a given mission and which influence the
design include: Sensitivity, Resolution, Dynamic range, Spectral
response, Frame rate/bandwidth, Optics compatibility, Image
motion, Radiation resistance, Size, Weight, Power, and
Reliability.</p>

 <strong>Abstract:</strong>: Criteria and recommended practices for preventing
stress-corrosion cracking from impairing the structural integrity
and flightworthiness of space vehicles are presented. The
important variables affecting stress-corrosion cracking are
considered to be the environment, including time and temperature;
metal composition, and structure; and sustained tensile stress.
For designing spacecraft structures that are free of
stress-corrosion cracking for the service life of the vehicle the
following rules apply: (1) identification and control of the
environments to which the structure will be exposed during
construction, storage, transportation, and use; (2) selection of
alloy compositions and tempers which are resistant to
stress-corrosion cracking in the identified environment; (3)
control of fabrication and other processes which may introduce
residual tensile stresses or damage the material; (4) limitation
of the combined residual and applied tensile stresses to below
the threshold stress level for the onset of cracking throughout
the service life of the vehicle; and (5) establishment of a
thorough inspection program.</p>

<strong>Abstract:</strong>: The injector in a liquid rocket engine atomizes and
mixes the fuel with the oxidizer to produce efficient and stable
combustion that will provide the required thrust without
endangering hardware durability. Injectors usually take the form
of a perforated disk at the head of the rocket engine combustion
chamber, and have varied from a few inches to more than a yard in
diameter. This monograph treats specifically bipropellant
injectors, emphasis being placed on the liquid/liquid and
liquid/gas injectors that have been developed for and used in
flight-proven engines. The information provided has limited
application to monopropellant injectors and gas/gas propellant
systems. Critical problems that may arise during injector
development and the approaches that lead to successful design are
discussed.</p>

well. The monograph covers four broad areas: (1) materials, (2)
design, (3) fracture control, and (4) design verification. The
materials portion deals with such subjects as material system
design, material design levels, and material characterization.
The design portion includes panel, shell, and joint design,
applied loads, internal loads, design factors, reliability, and
maintainability. Fracture control includes such items as stress
concentrations, service-life philosophy, and the management plan
for control of fracture-related aspects of structural design

 <strong>Abstract:</strong>: Guidelines for the successful design of pressurization
systems for main propulsion, auxiliary propulsion, and attitude
control systems for boosters, upper stages, and spacecraft were
presented, drawing on the wealth of design experience that has
accumulated in the development of pressurization systems for
liquid rockets operational in the last 15 years. The design
begins with a preliminary phase in which the system requirements
are received and evaluated. Next comes a detail-design and
integration phase in which the controls and the hardware
components that make up the system are determined. The final
phase, design evaluation, provides analysis of problems that may
arise at any point in the design when components are combined and
considered for operation as a system. Throughout the monograph,
the design tasks are considered in the order and manner in which
the designer must handle them.</p>

<strong>Abstract:</strong>: Thrust vector control systems that superimpose a side
force on the motor thrust, steering being achieved by the side
force causing a moment about the vehicle center of gravity are
described. A brief review of thrust vector control systems is
presented, and two systems, flexible joint and liquid injection,
are treated in detail. Treatment of the flexible-joint thrust
vector control system is limited to the design of the flexible
joint and its insulation against hot motor gases. Treatment of
the liquid injection thrust vector control system is limited to
discussion of the injectant, valves, piping, storage tanks, and
pressurization system; no evaluation is presented of the nozzle
except for (1) the effect of the injectant and erosion at the
injection port and (2) the effect of injection on pressure
distribution within the nozzle.</p>

<strong>Keywords:</strong> spacecraft propulsion and power, nozzle

aerodynamics, heat shielding, high temperature propellants,
performance prediction, structural design, thermal
insulation<br>
 <strong>Abstract:</strong>: The steps in the nozzle design process are examined.
The nozzle designer's role in defining design requirements and
constraints is included along with discussions of each of the
three basic phases of the nozzle design process itself: (1)
aerodynamic design, in which the gas-contacting surfaces are
configured to produce the required performance within the
envelope limits; (2) thermal design, in which thermal liners and
thermal insulators are selected and configured to maintain the
surfaces as closely as practical against effects of erosion and
to limit the structure temperature to acceptable levels; and (3)
structural design, in which materials are selected and configured
to support the thermal components and to sustain the predicted
loads. Analytical techniques that are used to establish thermal
and structural design integrity and to predict nozzle performance
are discussed along with methods for nozzle quality assurance.
Emphasis is placed on nozzle design and materials for modern
high-temperature aluminized propellants. Recurring nozzle design
problems of graphite cracking and ejection, differential erosion
at material interfaces, lack of sufficient proven nondestructive
testing (NDT) techniques, the uncertainty of adhesive bonding,
and inadequate definition of material properties, particularly at
high temperatures are considered.</p>

 <strong>Abstract:</strong>: The most frequently used formulations of the
gravitational field are discussed and a standard set of models
for the gravity fields of the earth, moon, sun, and other massive
bodies in the solar system are defined. The formulas are
presented in standard forms, some with instructions for
conversion. A point-source or inverse-square model, which
represents the external potential of a spherically symmetrical
mass distribution by a mathematical point mass without physical
dimensions, is considered. An oblate spheroid model is presented,
accompanied by an introduction to zonal harmonics. This spheroid
model is generalized and forms the basis for a number of the
spherical harmonic models which were developed for the earth and
moon. The triaxial ellipsoid model is also presented. These
models and their application to space missions are discussed.</p>

 <strong>Abstract:</strong>: The design of space vehicles for operation in
interplanetary space is given, based on descriptions of solar
wind, solar particle events, and galactic cosmic rays. A
state-of-the-art review is presented and design criteria are
developed from experiment findings aboard interplanetary and
high-altitude earth-orbiting spacecraft. Solar cells were found
to be particularly sensitive. Solar protons may also impact the
reliability of electric propulsion systems and spacecraft
surfaces, as well as causing interference, detector saturation,
and spurious signals. Galactic cosmic-ray impact can lead to
similar electronic failure and interference and may register in
photographic films and other emulsions. It was concluded that
solar wind electron measurements might result from differential
charging when shadowed portions of the spacecraft acquired a
negative charge from electron impact.</p>

<strong>Keywords:</strong> spacecraft propulsion and power, liquid

prediction, spacecraft, structural weight, weight reduction<br>
 <strong>Abstract:</strong>: The nozzle is a major component of a rocket engine,
having a significant influence on the overall engine performance
and representing a large fraction of the engine structure. The
design of the nozzle consists of solving simultaneously two
different problems: the definition of the shape of the wall that
forms the expansion surface, and the delineation of the nozzle
structure and hydraulic system. This monography addresses both of
these problems. The shape of the wall is considered from
immediately upstream of the throat to the nozzle exit for both
bell and annular (or plug) nozzles. Important aspects of the
methods used to generate nozzle wall shapes are covered for
maximum-performance shapes and for nozzle contours based on
criteria other than performance. The discussion of structure and
hydraulics covers problem areas of regeneratively cooled
tube-wall nozzles and extensions; it treats also nozzle
extensions cooled by turbine exhaust gas, ablation-cooled
extensions, and radiation-cooled extensions. The techniques that
best enable the designer to develop the nozzle structure with as
little difficulty as possible and at the lowest cost consistent
with minimum weight and specified performance are described.</p>

<strong>Keywords:</strong> spacecraft propulsion and power,

engines, temperature control, ablation, adiabatic conditions,
heat sinks, internal flow, wall temperature<br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong>: Self-cooled combustion chambers are chambers in which
the chamber wall temperature is controlled by methods other than
fluid flow within the chamber wall supplied from an external
source. In such chambers, adiabatic wall temperature may be
controlled by use of upstream fluid components such as the
injector or a film-coolant ring, or by internal flow of
self-contained materials; e.g. pyrolysis gas flow in charring
ablators, and the flow of infiltrated liquid metals in porous
matrices. Five types of self-cooled chambers are considered in
this monograph. The name identifying the chamber is indicative of
the method (mechanism) by which the chamber is cooled, as
follows: ablative; radiation cooled; internally regenerative
(Interegen); heat sink; adiabatic wall. Except for the Interegen
and heat sink concepts, each chamber type is discussed
separately. A separate and final section of the monograph deals
with heat transfer to the chamber wall and treats Stanton number
evaluation, film cooling, and film-coolant injection techniques,
since these subjects are common to all chamber types. Techniques
for analysis of gas film cooling and liquid film cooling are
presented.</p>
