<h3>SECTION 2 - ROCKETRY CLASSES:</h3>

<p class="green">Model Rocketry:</p> <p>The kind of rockets everyone fooled around with as a kid. It uses only premanufactured, solid motors from class A to G. Restrictions: GLOW not
to exceed 1500g; Each motor not to exceed 62.5g propellant and/or 160 NS impulse; Total
propellant not to exceed 125g; No metal structural parts.</p>
  
<p class="green">HPR - High Power Rocketry:</p>
<p>Scaled up model rocketry, using the same basic methods for construction, though metal parts can be used if necessary. It uses only premanufactured solid or hybrid motors from H to O. There are no weight restrictions, but each motor may not exceed 40,960 NS impulse
and the total impulse may not exceed 81,920 NS.</p>

<p class="green">Amateur Rocketry:</p>
<p>Anything that falls between HPR and professional rocketry. This includes liquid fueled engines, metal structures, building your own motors, and just about anything else you can think of. There are no formal definitions or requirements, other than the laws of physics and your government.</p>
  
<p class="green">Experimental Rocketry:</p>
<p>Different people have used this to mean different things, but essentially it's the same as amateur rocketry. The term is generally used by HPR people to refer to TRA sanctioned amateur rocketry</p>

<p class="green">Professional Rocketry:</p>
<p>Rocketry conducted for profit, usually by governments or large
corporations.</p>

<h3>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h3>

<p class="green">1) Which is best for amateur rocketry: solid, liquid, or hybrid propulsion?</p>

<p>The question gets a lot of debate. As with anything else, it depends on a number of factors, and there's no definite answer. Factors that should be considered include: your personal background and knowledge; size of rocket; impulse required; specific impulse desired; thrust; monies available; reliability factor; materials and equipment available; legal aspects; etc.</p>

<p>Generally, very small rockets (up to several kg or tens of kg) are easiest to build as solids or hybrids, and a lot of the technology is already available. Liquids provide the highest specific impulse and are most economical in larger sizes but are more complex. Hybrids tend to bridge the gap between liquids and solids, providing better impulse in mid-size than solids and being simpler than liquids.</p>

<p class="green">2) "How do I build rocket motors?"</p>
<p>There is no easy answer to this. You need to buy the books, join an amateur group, do the research, and understand what you're doing. Blindly following a recipe you found is asking for the sudden removal of your extremities.</p>

<p class="green">3) "Where can I get LOX?"</p> <!-- Same place you get bagels? -->
<p>Check with welding supply companies in your area or with the local outlets of Air Liquide and Praxair, listed in the SUPPLIERS section. If all else fails, medical supply companies sell it for respirators, though you'll pay through the nose (pun intended) and they may have restrictions. Price varies widely, so shop around.
</p>

<p class="green">4) "Where can I get transducers, DAQ boards, valves, fiberglass, etc?"</p>
<p><a href="http://www.omega.com">Omega</a>  offers a very wide selection of data collection material, their prices can be a little steep for the amateur.  <a href="http://www.dataq.com">DataQ</a>  offers a very <a href="http://www.dataq.com/194.htm">reasonably priced serial port data collection module</a> that is ideal for the beginner.</p>

<p class="green">5) "Putting a rocket into orbit looks easy. How come no amateur has done it yet?"</p>
<p>Short answer: Because it ain't easy, not even close.</p>
<p>Long answer: There are several inter-related reasons: Scalability, Materials, Methods, Development, Cost, Time and Paperwork.</p>

<p><strong class="blue">SCALABILITY</strong>: Some rocket components are impractical on a small scale, for instance turbopumps and hydraulic systems. Rockets also suffer from the effects of the cube/square law as they get smaller, particularly tanks.
</p>
<p><strong class="blue">MATERIALS</strong>: There is a sliding scale of price and performance: steel,aluminum, alloys, fiberglass, graphite, and someday, buckytube. Generally, the higher the strength to weight ratio, the higher the price. Graphite fibre is <em>expensive</em>. And if you go cheap, performance suffers.</p>

<p><strong class="blue">METHODS</strong>: Advanced manufacturing techniques are a stretch for the average amateur. Not many of us can afford a filament winding machine. You could build one of course, but that's a project by itself. And the best way to implement regenerative cooling is to machine the coolant passages in the walls of the engine, fill them with wax, electro-deposit a "roof" and then melt the wax out. Possible, but a major undertaking.
If you contract for those kinds of jobs, you drive the price way up, and if you use simpler methods, performance suffers.</p>

<p><strong class="blue">DEVELOPMENT</strong>: You can't buy a kit, slap the pieces together, and put a satellite in orbit (not yet anyway.) This is real R&amp;D: you're going to have to build a prototype, test it, build another, test it, build another and soon. For each of three stages. And things go wrong: valves stick, plumbing leaks, rockets blow up. And then there's the support equipment; you're going to have to build a test stand, data acquisition system, fuel loader, launch pad, tracking system and more. All of this takes time and, yes, money</p>

<p><strong class="blue">COST</strong>: The big one. All the other factors contribute to the cost, and it adds up in a hurry. How much would it cost to do a "Sputnik?" More than $25,000. Some groups have spent that much already, and are still nowhere near orbit. $100,000 is probably in the ballpark. (Note: that's the cost of the entire program, not just the flight.)</p>

<p><strong class="blue">TIME</strong>: The key word here is "amateur." These people are not paid to build rockets. They have regular jobs and only do it in their spare time. This doubles or triples development time.</p><!-- Note the root of the word *amateur* - same as the root of amour!  Amateurs do whatever because they love it.-->

<p><strong class="blue">PAPERWORK</strong>:  Obtaining the necessary permits to place an object in orbit is particularly difficult, considering the value of orbital assets.  Insurance to protect your ground overflight and these orbital assets is very expensive also.</p>

<p>Short answer #2: If that still doesn't convince you, try it yourself.</p>

<p class="green">6) "What materials should I use for my rocket motor?"</p>
<p>In Appendix C of Huzel &amp; Huang there is a brief description of the materials being used in modern rocket engines.</p>

<p class="green">7) "Why don't we start a newsgroup for amateur rockets instead of a mailing list?"</p>
<p>Mailing lists have a very strong self-selection factor; you have to want to join up. Moving to a newsgroup would bring a higher profile, but it would also bring spammers, flamers and the truly clueless. The average IQ in USENET has been plunging in recent years, with no sign of bottom. Most of us do not want to be pestered by endless repetitions of Question #2.</p>
